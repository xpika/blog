Type systems are often touted as making software more secure and more performant. However there is another dimension that I would like to discuss. Documentation. If you look at much python code you can be stuck worrying just what you are meant to place as arguments to functions. If you are dealing with a large library it's not so much an issue, but what if you are looking at the internals of a library or a smaller library it can be. If you look at open source Javascript projects you will often see documentation for functions with a consistent layout. Int for integers and Strings for strings etcetera. What about creating a linter that requires that the documentation be kept to a standard? In effect you have created a type checker. Type checkers could also be called "documentation guarantors".
