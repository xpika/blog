I'm fascinated by the phenomena of relicing. For those that don't know, relicing is refereed to guitars that are damaged in ways that make them look older.

One reason for its appeal may be the ambiguity in damage. Usually the critical parts are left undamaged. This could be like in the same way that a chimney sweeper would wear black as opposed to white like a doctor.

Another reason might be that if something looks damaged, it can look older and having survived a longer time and thus be more valuable.

Another reason is for the trained eye it can be quite a perceivable pattern. I found a book of old documents and it had what I thought had a really cool embossing effect like it had a coffee mug on it. It turned out that it really had had a coffee mug on it when i scratched a bit of the stain off.

Whatever the reason it does seem like quite a paradoxical taste.

What other things could be reliced?
