The lisp language is characterized by "s" expressions, a syntax even more basic than XML. This syntax can be equally used for data and code. Unfortunately, since it was so easy to make a compiler for the syntax, no one could ever agree on which compiler to use. So it is divided up among the likes of:
<ul>
	<li>Scheme</li>
	<li>Common lisp</li>
	<li>Emacs Lisp</li>
</ul>
Despite the fragmentation, here are some things made with Lisp
<ul>
	<li>Maxima (algebra system) (Common lisp)</li>
	<li>GnuCash (accounting software) (Sheme)</li>
	<li>Emacs (Text editor) (Emacs lisp)</li>
</ul>
