Note: this is an old article I wrote around 2004 which IÂ have transferred to this blog.

<u>Scenario:</u>

You go over to your friend(some friend...) house or anywhere which has a stock installation of IE and you realize:
"Oh no, my Google Search bar has gone. That means you will have to traverse one more link before arriving at my destination"(xxl0litaz.net etc).

This tutorial is an attempt at avoiding the usual break out of rage which typically occurs in such situations.

<u>Solution:</u>

Type in the address bar:
<i>google.com/search?q=&lt;search-query&gt;</i>

eg. <span class="inlinecode">google.com/search?q=chuck+norris</span>
note: terms dilimited by "+" signs.

eg2. <span class="inlinecode">google.com/search?q=%20chuck+norris%20</span>
note: quotes are specified by the string "%20".

eg3. <span class="inlinecode">google.com/search?q=chuck+norris+facts&amp;btni</span>*
note: The btni specifies the magic Google option I'm Feeling
lucky which can effectively save 2 links.
*remember the "I" in "btnI" is case sensitive.

eg4. <span class="inlinecode">google.com/groups/search?q=chuck+norris</span>
note: adding /groups/ will make it try search within google groups

eg5. <span class="inlinecode">google.com/group/alt.whateva</span>
note: this is the quick way to access your fav group

eg6. <span class="inlinecode">google.com/groups/dir?q=chuck+norris</span>
note: this is the way to search for a particular group.


There is heaps more you can do with google searches if you
go to the site and click help. this stuff is just
undocumented by them.
