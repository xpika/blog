1. Line breaks
In Windows, Newline is represented as \r\n. That's two escape characters per newline. In unix it's only \n.

2. Directory Names
In unix, directories are separated with a forward slash, but in windows it's a backslash. Backslash is also however the character used for escaping other characters. In windows, to specify a directory with a space in it you must surround the path with quotes.

3. Soft links
Windows has shortcuts, try opening a shortcut in a text editor and you will see why soft links are better.
