Say you have a site and 0.01% of people use IE8 that is not a good reason not to support it because those people that don't use the site won't show up as often.

Even if you do use The Unique visitors option this is still a misleading statistic because most people don't use static IPs. If they useÂ mobile devices, those will be even more likely to use dynamic IP's. There is more to this however.I speculate that people using old browsers exists in clusters of old browser networks, so a bottleneck has been created.

Lastly, I would like to say that people using the browsers that came with their operating system are probably the least likely to be able to install a new browser and so the importance of browser availability is only more important.
