People familiar with ascii know that there are multiple ways to express horizontal whitespace. Tab and space.

This may have been to save people from typing space too often when doing things like indenting. Another notable redundancy is the backspace and left arrow + delete.

One sticking point of being a developer is going into a codebase adding some indentation checking it in. Then finding your spaces and tabs don't align.
