My Experience with debugging PHP

1. What is x debug? What does the X stand for? Does this even debug PHP or does it debug X windows? If there are no other debuggers worth considering, I should not need to know it's name.

2. You have to enable zend extension. What's zend? Should I need to know anything about Zend to configure debugging?

3. A shared object file? I just want to turn it on not specify which copy of the debugger to use.

4.Why require me to edit a configuration file for anything? The file could be located almost anywhere. In Visual studio, you can just click debug. In Node you just type node-inspector your-script.js and it pulls up a web based debugger.

Debugging tools are a great learning aid and should be made as available as possible for novice users.
