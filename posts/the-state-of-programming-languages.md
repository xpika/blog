As people have said, Javascript has become the bytecode of the internet. I think this merits a new name, which I will call  "webcode". The Typescript language adds static typing to javascript so i think it is a good candidate for a language that compiles to webcode. Here are some more languages and the niches they fill.
<ul>
	<li>Assembly - Compile to specific machine code</li>
	<li>C - Compile - Compile to machine code</li>
	<li>Java - Compile to bytecode</li>
	<li>C# - Compile to bytecode with specialised microsoft support</li>
	<li>Objective C - Compile to hardware with specialised apple support</li>
	<li>JavaScript - Run interpreted with special browser support</li>
	<li>F#  - Compile High level code to bytecode with special microsoft support</li>
	<li>Haskell - Compile High level code to machine code</li>
	<li>Clojure - Compile high level code to java bytecode or webcode.</li>
	<li>Scala - Compile high level code to bytecode with java and static types.</li>
	<li>TypeScript - Compile to webcode with static types.</li>
</ul>

Edit 4/02/2015:
<ul>
	<li>Go - C with garbage collection</li>
</ul>
