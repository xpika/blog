Practice makes perfect. Or so is said. Want to be good at writing? Just do it many times and you will become perfect at it. Something is missing from this. The part where you learn.

Experimentation is essential for overall improvement, although this sounds quite trite, I think it's more accurate than the quantity argument. Learning something can take a long time, and when you are changing one thing at a time as is most manageable, you will find yourself going through many of the motions you have gone through before. This part is often refereed to as the practice.

The point I'm trying to make is that if you don't make enough changes when practicing it will take away the precious time you have to actually learn something. Keep in mind the amount of changes you are making because you may be falling into the quantity fallacy. Also try to go to lengths to reduce the time in your experimentation which does not involve any changes.

Another way of looking at it is from the following quote in the form of a question.
<blockquote>"Did you gain 10 years of experience or just 1 year of experience 10 times?"</blockquote>
There is a real sense in which repetition does make perfect, This is in regards to biology. Stretching muscle long enough will eventually leave it loose like a rubber band. There is also a similar concept in regards to memory whereÂ you can recall something quicker if you think it more often.
