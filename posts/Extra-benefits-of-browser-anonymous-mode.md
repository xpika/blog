When you click the "incognito" mode in chrome or the "private" mode in firefox you can feel as anonymous as someone in disguise. This has many benefits such as:
<ul>
	<li>Stopping others from viewing your history when you are "Away From Keyboard"</li>
	<li>Good for using a web site when you are already logged as another user. This is handy for when you have multiple accounts or need to do some cross user testing.</li>
	<li>Don't have to worry about signing out of apps before closing if you area using someone else's computer. Effectively makes it a Kiosk Mode.</li>
</ul>
